    Generate spatial null maps via eigenstrapping [1]_.
    
    This function generates spatial null maps that preserve the spatial autocorrelation structure of
    brain maps through random rotation of geometric eigenmodes. The method works by rotating
    eigenmodes within eigengroups (sets of modes with similar eigenvalues), then reconstructing null
    maps using the original decomposition coefficients.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like
        Empirical brain map(s) of shape ``(n_verts,)`` or ``(n_verts, n_maps)`` to generate nulls from. If
        n_maps > 1, the same set of randomized rotations is applied to all maps for each null (see
        Notes). 
    emodes : array-like
        The eigenmodes array of shape ``(n_verts, n_modes)``. This function rotates modes within
        eigengroups. Note that, unlike the original implementation [1]_, this requires the constant
        mode (the first column) to be input too. By default (if ``n_groups`` is None), if the number of
        eigenmodes is not a perfect square (i.e., the number of modes does not allow for complete
        eigengroups), then the last incomplete eigengroup will be excluded.
    evals : array-like
        The eigenvalues array of shape ``(n_modes,)``. Note that, unlike the original
        implementation [1]_, this requires the zero eigenvalue (the first eigenvalue) to be input
        too. 
    n_nulls : int, optional
        Number of null maps to generate per input map. Default is 1000.
    n_groups : int or None, optional
        Number of eigengroups to use for generating nulls. If ``None``, uses all complete
        eigengroups contained in ``emodes`` (⌊√(n_modes)⌋). Default is ``None``.
    rotation_method : str, optional
        The method used to generate random rotations for each eigengroup. Either ``'qr'`` to
        generate random orthogonal matrices using QR decomposition of random normal matrices, or
        ``'scipy'`` to sample random orthogonal matrices from SO(N) using
        ``scipy.stats.special_ortho_group.rvs``. Default is ``'qr'``. See Notes for details on which
        option to choose.
    randomize : bool, optional
        Whether to shuffle decomposition coefficients within eigengroups. This increases
        randomization but reduces spatial autocorrelation similarity to empirical data. Default is
        ``False``.
    residual : str, optional
        How to handle reconstruction residuals after generating null maps. Either ``None`` to
        exclude residuals, ``'add'`` to add original residuals, or ``'permute'`` to adds shuffled
        residuals. Default is ``None``. See Notes for details on which option to choose.
    resample : bool, optional
        How to resample values from original data. Options are ``'exact'`` to match the sorted
        distribution of the original data, ``'affine'`` to match the original mean and standard
        deviation, ``'mean'`` to match the mean, and ``'range'`` to match the minimum and maximum.
        Default is ``None`` for no resampling.
    decomp_method : str, optional
        The method used for eigendecomposition, either ``'project'`` to project data into a
        mass-orthonormal space or ``'regress'`` for least-squares fitting. Default is ``'project'``.
    mass : array-like, optional
        The mass matrix of shape ``(n_verts, n_verts)`` used for the decomposition when
        ``decomp_method`` is ``'project'``. Default is ``None``.
    seed : array-like or int, optional
        Random seed for reproducibility. If an array of shape ``(n_nulls,)`` is provided, it is used
        directly as the seed for each null. Otherwise, if a single integer is provided, it is used
        to generate a master seed that is then used to generate a different seed for each null. If
        ``None``, the global state is used. Default is ``None``.
    check_ortho : bool, optional
        Whether to check if ``emodes`` are mass-orthonormal before using the ``'project'`` method in
        :func:`neuromodes.basis.decompose`. Default is ``True``.
    
    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of shape ``(n_verts, n_nulls)`` or ``(n_verts, n_nulls, n_maps)``
        Generated null maps of shape ``(n_verts, n_nulls)`` if ``data`` has shape ``(n_verts,)``, or
        ``(n_verts, n_nulls, n_maps)`` if ``data`` has shape ``(n_verts, n_maps)``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``emodes`` is not a 2D array or has n_verts ≥ n_modes.
    ValueError
        If ``evals`` length doesn't match number of columns in ``emodes``.
    ValueError
        If ``residual`` is not one of ``None``, ``'add'``, or ``'permute'``.
    ValueError
        If ``resample`` is not one of ``None``, ``'exact'``, ``'affine'``, ``'mean'``, or
        ``'range'``.
    ValueError
        If ``rotation_method`` is not one of ``'qr'`` or ``'scipy'``.
    ValueError
        If ``n_groups`` is greater than the number of eigengroups than can be formed from the number
        of modes in ``emodes``.

    Notes
    -----
    1. Same transformations for each map. When ``data`` contains multiple maps (n_maps > 1), the
       same set of randomized rotations is applied to all maps for each null. This means that null i
       for map A and null i for map B use identical eigenmode rotations (± coefficient
       randomizations and residual permutations).

    2. ``n_groups`` and ``residual``. The choice of ``n_groups`` and ``residual`` will affect the
       spatial autocorrelation similarity between the nulls and empirical data. See ref [1]_ for a
       heuristic for choosing ``n_groups`` and to see how the choice of ``residual`` affects the
       spatial autocorrelation of the nulls.

    3. ``rotation_method``. ``rotation_method="scipy"`` is largely a legacy option to match the
       original implementation of eigenstrapping, which uses this method. The scipy method is
       recommended only for users who want to exactly match the original implementation of
       eigenstrapping. ``rotation_method="qr"`` is generally faster, especially for larger numbers
       of modes and nulls, and is recommended for most users. See more similarities/differences in
       the notes below.

    4. ``resample``. The choice of ``resample`` will affect the distribution of values in the nulls.
       ``'mean'``, ``'affine'``, and ``'range'`` are linear transformations, while ``'exact'`` is a
       non-linear transformation. ``'mean'`` preserves the location (mean) of the distribution,
       while ``'affine'`` preserves the location and scale (mean and standard deviation) of the
       distribution. As these are both affine transformations, they preserve the "relative PSD" of
       the distribution. In contrast, ``'range'`` and ``'exact'`` do not preserve the relative PSD
       of the distribution, as they change the location and scale of the reconstructed nulls. The
       choice of ``resample`` should be guided by the importance of matching the original
       distribution of values and ultimately by whichever option produces the lowest false discovery
       rate (FDR). See ref [1]_ for an example of how to compute the FDR.

    5. ``seed``. Seeding is handled in one or two stages. First, if ``seed`` is None or a scalar
       integer, it is used to generate an array of size ``(n_nulls,)``. (If ``seed`` is already an array
       of size ``(n_nulls,)``, it is used directly.) Then, each of the ``n_nulls`` seeds are used to
       generate 3 new seeds: for rotations, randomisations, and residual permutations (if
       randomisations/permutations are not requested, these will be generated but not used). This
       ensures that the same seed will produce the same nulls regardless of how many nulls are
       generated (e.g., if n_nulls is increased from 10 to 100, the first 10 nulls will be
       identical).

    6. Comparisons with original implementation. The following notes are in relation to the original
       implementation of eigenstrapping in ref [1]_, which is available `here
       <https://github.com/SNG-Newy/eigenstrapping/tree/c2d8e5a5e7af47649f6358334644a6b49d22cf8e>`__.
       In this function, we have made a few changes to the implementation. These changes simplify
       installation, increase speed, process multiple maps concurrently, and facilitate
       reproducibility. Nonetheless, under a specific configuration, the function can exactly match
       the default usage of the implementation (i.e. generating the same nulls when the
       corresponding seed is set). See `this notebook
       <https://neuromodes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation/nulls_eigenstrap_orig.html>`__
       for an example.

       a. Simplified installation. ``eigenstrapping`` is dependent on many packages, including exact
          versions of ``brainspace`` and ``lapy``. In contrast, ``neuromodes`` depends on much fewer
          dependencies. This makes installation easier and reduces the risk of conflicts with other
          packages.

       b. Speed comparison. When generating 1000 nulls for one map on a 4k surface using 100 modes,
          the methods take:

          i. ``SurfaceEigenstrapping(n=1000)``:         3.80 seconds
          ii. ``eigenstrap(rotation_method='scipy')``:  1.12 seconds (exactly the same output as i)
          iii. ``eigenstrap(rotation_method='qr')``:    0.10 seconds

          See `this notebook
          <https://neuromodes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation/nulls_eigenstrap_speed.html>`__
          for more comparisons between the ``'scipy'`` and ``'qr'`` methods.

       c. Lack of cholmod. The original implementation uses ``cholmod`` for fast sparse matrix
          operations when computing the original calculation of geometric eigenmodes. In contrast,
          in order to simplify installation, this implementation does not use ``cholmod``. This has
          some impacts on how quickly modes can be computed. However, as they can be computed once
          and then saved, we hope that this will not be a major issue for users (we welcome
          contributions to add support for this!).

       d. Lack of parallelization from ``joblib``. The original implementation uses ``joblib`` to
          parallelize the generation of nulls across multiple CPU cores. Given our generation of
          nulls is faster, we have not implemented that at this stage. We welcome contributions to
          add support for this, but not that it may be difficult to implement this in a way that is
          reproducible across different numbers of nulls/maps/cores/seeding strategies. We note that
          the original implementation is not reproducible when using ``joblib`` due to the order in
          which the seeds are generated/used.

       e. Only match default. We are able to exactly match the default functionality of the original
          implementation, but not all possible configurations. This is because of some changes we
          have made to increase speed and facilitate reproducibility. In particular, when
          ``randomize=False`` and ``residual=None``, the output of
          ``eigenstrap(rotation_method='scipy')`` will match the original output (see below for more
          parameters which also need to be specified). However, if ``randomize=True`` or
          ``residual='permute'``, it is not possible to match results between the two
          implementations. This is because of changes we have made to increase speed.

       f. Changes to RNG. Here, we have changed to ``numpy``'s newer ``Generator`` for random number
          generation, which means that the global seed does not affect the output of the function
          when using ``rotation_method='qr'``. This is in contrast to the original implementation,
          which used the legacy ``RandomState`` approach. See the last paragraph in the `'Quick
          Start' section
          <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html#random-quick-start>`__ for more
          information about the change. In particular, the original implementation was affected by
          the global seed when using ``seed=None``; this is preserved in ``rotation_method='scipy'``
          for compatibility, but not in ``rotation_method='qr'``.

       g. Use of first mode: This function uses the constant mode (first column of ``emodes``) and
          its corresponding eigenvalue to generate mean-preserving nulls. In contrast, the original
          implementation excludes the constant mode and its eigenvalue. Whereas in the original
          implementation users were expected to input ``emodes`` and ``evals`` with the constant
          mode/eigenvalue removed (something of the form ``emodes[:, 1:]`` and ``evals[1:]``), here
          users are expected to input ``emodes`` and ``evals`` with the constant mode/eigenvalue
          included. This has minimal changes to the functionality of the code, other than this
          syntactic change.

       h. Concurrent processing of multiple maps. This function can process multiple maps at the
          same time. This was possible in the original implementation, but required users to save
          rotation matrices and reapply them to all maps.

       i. Resample AND add residuals: If both resampling and adding residuals is requested, the
          original implementation adds residuals after resampling. Here, the order of these steps is
          swapped (ie, add residuals and then resample). This ensures that the resampling remains
          intact (e.g., that the surrogates and original actually have the same values). If
          (instead) the resampling is done before the residuals are added, then neither step will
          remain intact. This difference is only relevant if both ``resample`` and ``residual`` are
          used.

       j. Syntax for exact replication. To exactly match the default version of the original
          implementation of eigenstrapping in ref [1]_, users specify the following input parameters
          to this function:

          - Ensure ``data`` has a mean of zero.
          - Set ``seed=seed``
          - Set ``resample="range"``
          - Set ``decomp_method="regress"``
          - Set ``rotation_method="scipy"``

          Note that the original implementation (``eigenstrapping.SurfaceEigenstrapping``) must also
          be run with a particular configuration to ensure reproducibility/compatibility:

          - Set the global seed before running ``SurfaceEigenstrapping(...)`` (e.g.,
            ``np.random.seed(seed)``).
          - Additionally, pass this seed into the function call: ``SurfaceEigenstrapping(...,
            seed=seed)``
          - Remember to remove the first eigenmode/eigenvalue from the call to
            ``SurfaceEigenstrapping``

          For an example of how to do this, see `this notebook
          <https://neuromodes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation/nulls_eigenstrap_orig.html>`__.

    """
    Rotate coefficients using ``scipy.stats.special_ortho_group.rvs`` to sample random orthogonal
    matrices from SO(N). This is largely a legacy option to match the original implementation of
    eigenstrapping, which uses this method. The QR method is generally faster, especially for larger
    numbers of modes and nulls, and is recommended for most users. The scipy method is recommended
    only for users who want to exactly match the original implementation of eigenstrapping.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inv_coeffs : array-like
        The inverse-transformed coefficients (spheroid -> ellipsoid) of shape (n_modes, n_nulls,
        n_maps) to rotate.
    groups : list of arrays
        A list of arrays, where each array contains the indices of modes belonging to the same
        eigengroup.
    seeds : array-like
        An array of integer seeds of shape (n_nulls,) to use for reproducibility of the random
        rotations for each null map.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray of shape ``(n_modes, n_nulls, n_maps)``
        The rotated coefficients (spheroid -> ellipsoid) to use for generating null maps.

    Notes
    -----
    We cannot use ``special_ortho_group.rvs(..., size=len(seeds))`` here in order to match the
    original implementation. This is because the rotations have to be generated separately for each
    null. Due to how the random seed progresses when the rotations are generated, it is not possible
    to generate rotations for all nulls at once. For the same reason, the order of the following
    loops cannot be changed (must generate rotations for one null before moving on to the next
    null).

    Rotate coefficients using QR decomposition of random Gaussian matrices to generate random

    Parameters
    ----------

        The inverse-transformed coefficients (spheroid -> ellipsoid) of shape ``(n_modes, n_nulls,

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray of shape ``(n_modes, n_nulls, n_maps)``

    Notes
    -----
    We choose not to use ``special_ortho_group.rvs(..., size=len(seeds))`` here in order to
    facilitate generating rotations with precise seeding. We _could_ use this approach instead of
    defining our own helper, but it would not allow specific seeds to be used for each null.
    Instead, the user would have to pass a single seed which would then generate the rotations
    matrices for all the nulls. This would make it difficult to exactly replicate specific nulls,
    thus impairing replicability. Instead, we unwrap the code in ``special_ortho_group.rvs``: we
    generate random Gaussian matrices ourself (using specific seeds for each null), and then use
    the same procedure as in that function (also in a vectorised manner).
